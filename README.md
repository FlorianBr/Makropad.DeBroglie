# Debroglie Lightning 25 / DZTech Winry 25tf

![Makropad2](winry.jpg)

Another makropad from Aliexpress. 5x5 hotswap sockets with Gateron Reds, Mega32U4, per Key RGB LEDs, 8 downlights, dfu bootloader.
Current versions of QMK have that keyboard as winry/winry25tc. But not with a full LED Matrix configuration.

 - Keys: Gateron Red
 - Keycaps: Some leftovers

# Howto install:

- Copy or symlink the keymap directory to <QMK>/keyboards/winry/winry25tc/keymaps
- Copy or symlink the keyboard.json to <QMK>/keyboards/winry/winry25tc and replace the existing one
- Build and flash with qmk flash -kb winry/winry25tc -km <SYMLINKDIR>
