# Debroglie Lightning 25 / DZTech Winry 25tf

![Makropad2](winry.jpg)

Another makropad from Aliexpress. 5x5 hotswap sockets with Gateron Reds, Mega32U4, per Key RGB LEDs, 8 downlights, dfu bootloader. On USB it says dztech winry 25tf, PCB says Debroglie Lightning 25. Needed some reverse engineering to find out the pins for row, col and leds.

 - Keys: Gateron Red
 - Keycaps: Some leftovers
